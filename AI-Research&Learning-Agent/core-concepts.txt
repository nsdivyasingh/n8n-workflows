Core components for modeling or deploying AI agents:

1) Models
- The beating heart of an AI agent. 
- These are the foundation—large language models, vision models, multimodal models—that give the agent its ability to reason, generate, and respond. 
- The "intelligence" lives here.

2) Tools
- External powers the agent can call upon. 
- APIs, plugins, databases, calculators, or custom functions that extend the model’s raw capabilities into action in the real world.

3) Knowledge & Memory
- The agent’s sense of continuity. 
- Knowledge refers to what’s pre-trained into the model or added via retrieval (like documents or search). 
- Memory tracks ongoing interactions, context, or history—so the agent doesn’t feel forgetful.

4) Audio & Speech
- The voice and ears of the agent. 
- Speech-to-text for understanding humans, and text-to-speech for replying back. 
- This makes agents feel less like code and more like companions.

5) Guardrails
- The rules of the road. 
- Safety layers, filters, policies, and constraints that keep the agent from misbehaving, going off-topic, or producing harmful output. 
- Guardrails protect both the user and the system.

6) Orchestration
- The conductor of the whole symphony. 
- It decides when to call the model, when to fetch knowledge, when to use a tool, and how to weave everything into a smooth response. 
- Without orchestration, the agent is chaos.
